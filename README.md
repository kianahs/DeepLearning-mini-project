-	Train GoogLeNet, VGG16, and Resnet18 on the datasets (MNIST, CIFAR10, and CIFAR100) with different settings using PyTorch and Python for image classification tasks (50 different experiments).
-	Apply Data Augmentation techniques, learning rate scheduler, and different optimizers.
-	Change the models' architecture to adapt the datasets, and tune hyperparameters.
-	Analyse the influence of each hyperparameter and technique on classification results.
